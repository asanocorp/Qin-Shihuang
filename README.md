# Qin-Shihuang
programmers say: "demo or it didn't happen" so this is a demo of an interactive story of Qin-Shihuang based on The China History Podcast by Laszlo Montgomery and prepared for author's viewing pleasure.

the particular episode of the podcast can be [heard and downloaded on soundcloud here](http://chinahistorypodcast.com/chp-157-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-qin).

the main idea is to use awesome power of svg for enhancing the great story narrated in absolutely awesome way by LM with graphics and interactivity.

if you just want to get the feel of the story check out the [album on fb with the graphics as.jpg](https://goo.gl/tAE9NE) or see folder [/assets/_img_reuse_mod_Qin-Shihuang_/_img_traced_](https://github.com/projekt-kreatywa/Qin-Shihuang/tree/master/assets/_img_reuse_mod_Qin-Shihuang_/_img_traced_)
