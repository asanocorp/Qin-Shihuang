the story is that of Qin-Shihuang and is inspired and based on The China History Podcast by Laszlo Montgomery and prepared for author's viewing pleasure.

more info in [README.md](https://github.com/projekt-kreatywa/Qin-Shihuang) on github

the prototype at http://qin-shihuang.netlify.com/ <- netlify.com - i have a new bulid tool!!

live experiments as always in a collection on [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/collection/DYyOyo/)

the particular episode of the podcast can be [heard and downloaded on soundcloud here](http://chinahistorypodcast.com/chp-157-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-qin).

the main idea is to use awesome power of svg for enhancing the great story narrated in absolutely awesome way by LM with graphics and interactivity.

if you just want to get the feel of the story check out the [album on fb with the graphics as.jpg](https://goo.gl/tAE9NE) or see folder [/assets/_img_reuse_mod_Qin-Shihuang_/_img_traced_](https://github.com/projekt-kreatywa/Qin-Shihuang/tree/master/assets/_img_reuse_mod_Qin-Shihuang_/_img_traced_)
